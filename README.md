This website is really my first "real" project. I am trying to achieve an easy to access website, where you can track your items for CS2 (currently only CS, may change).


You're more than welcome to create an account and to leave feedback, however, your account may be deleted because this app is still under development.


TO-DO LIST:
Tracking a price point: Under the price metric will be an input, where you can enter your price. If the app is on in the background online and you have entered your desired price, an email (or a notification of some sorts) will be sent to you.
