This website is really my first "real" project. I am trying to achieve an easy to access website, where you can track your items for CS2 (currently only CS, may change).


You're more than welcome to create an account and to leave feedback, however, your account may be deleted because this app is still under development.


You can track basically any skin, if it's a short name "Kilowatt Case", "Glove Case", etc. - you can enter it straight away, with more complex items i.e. a well worn awp atheris - you have to find it on steam market and copy the part after 730 https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/AWP%20%7C%20Atheris%20(Well-Worn) - this is your input "AWP%20%7C%20Atheris%20(Well-Worn)".


Each and every skin inputted (max 5 currently) is refreshed every 5 minutes automatically, or can be updated via the "Manual refresh" button.


TO-DO LIST:
Tracking a price point: Under the price metric will be an input, where you can enter your price. If the app is on in the background online and you have entered your desired price, an email (or a notification of some sorts) will be sent to you.
